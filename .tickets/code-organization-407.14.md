# Docs: co template TUI usage + keybindings

Update documentation (README.md) to describe the new behavior:
- `co template` launches the Template Explorer TUI
- Basic navigation and tab hotkeys
- Creating a workspace from a template via the Create tab
- How template directories (primary + fallback) are searched and how location is shown

## Acceptance Criteria

- README documents the new `co template` default behavior
- Keybindings for the Template Explorer TUI are listed
- Template search path + precedence is documented
