# Epic: Template Explorer TUI enhancements

Follow-up enhancements for the Template Explorer TUI once the MVP is working.

These items improve inspection/debuggability of templates (rendered previews, output mapping, diagnostics) but are not required for the initial shipping version.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Enhancements are optional and can be implemented independently of the MVP epic
- Each enhancement has clear UX + acceptance criteria
