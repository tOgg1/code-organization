# Docs: update Remote Sync section for new excludes + interactive mode

Update README.md Remote Sync docs to reflect the expanded default excludes and the new interactive picker (flags, keybindings, persistence behavior if added). Keep docs consistent with implementation.

## Acceptance Criteria

README Remote Sync section documents: default excludes, --interactive usage + keybindings, and how to configure/override excludes.
